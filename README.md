# Word-Guess-Game

### Objective

-   Creating a themed hangman game

Used Javascript objects to hold related properties for a question. This would include the actual question, the answer,
and a related image.

Using key events, the program will keep check when the user enters a key, ensures the key is a character A-Z, and then
check if it is part of the answer. If it is part of the answer it will reveal/replace the letter in the current
underscored word.
